# Car Sales project
During this project we created a web app where people can see the full data frame of the car sales in the US and see the different characteristics that compose the price and how do they affect the price. We can also filter the data frame and create a new one to find easier a specific option by the different filtering methods. 
This web app is just a tool to simulate random events.
We worked with pandas, plotly express, maltplotlib and scipy stats for our code and streamlit to run and create our app.
